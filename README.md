## Pyforces

`Pyforces` is a study repo with a collection of solved (defeated) problems from different domains such as Hackerrank, LeetCode, etc. Gradually, more problems will be added and hopefully with better and clearer solutions for the problems.

## Tests

`Pyforces` contains tests for the defeated challenges. In order to run these, install the repo's dependencies and run the tests with `pytest`:

```sh
pipenv install --dev  # hopefully the venv will be activated
pytest  # defeat them all!
```
