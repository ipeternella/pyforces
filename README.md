## Pyforces

`Pyforces` is a study repo with a collection of solved (defeated) problems from different domains such as Hackerrank, LeetCode, etc. Gradually, more problems will be added and hopefully with better and clearer solutions for the problems.

## Powers

The `powers` folder contains some powerful algorithmitic techniques that can be used to defeat many "resistent" enemies (the coding challenges). Jokes aside, this folder contains some simple code snippets with important algorithms to keep in mind.

## Tests

`Pyforces` contains tests for the defeated challenges. In order to run these, install the repo's dependencies and run the tests with `pytest`:

```sh
pipenv install --dev  # hopefully the venv will be activated
pytest  # defeat them all!
```
